## 1. Urban Planning and Zonning ##
Urban Planning and Zoning is the process of designing and organizing the physical layout and infrastructure of urban areas to meet the needs of residents, businesses, and the environment. It involves strategic decision-making to balance land use, population density, transportation, and environmental sustainability.

For Urban Planning and Zoning, the most suitable algorithm is a Graph Algorithm, such as the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). MST helps design efficient infrastructure networks (e.g., roads, utilities) by minimizing the total cost of connecting different zones. Here, we are using Prim's algorithm since it is simple and efficient.
